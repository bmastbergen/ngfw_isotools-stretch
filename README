d-i is the debian installer; it is used mostly untouched, so the
Untangle changes are applied via 'make patch' (using d-i.patch), that
way moving to a new installer shouldn't be too hard.

d-i *packages sources* take up a lot of space, so I removed them from
the d-i/ directory altogether; packages we modified are built from
source from installer-pkgs-modified/, while installer-pkgs-original/
holds the binary versions of those packages we use untouched.

Diffs for those modified packages live in
installer-packages-modified/d-i_pkgs.patch, but as there are binary
changes in there (namely an additional GTK theme), manual patching can
possibly be required at some point.

simple-cdd profiles are stored in profiles. We use the current
simple-cdd from Debian, so it needs to be installed on the build
machine.

debian-cd is very slightly modified, and the corresponding diffs live
in debian-cd.patch, except for:

  - echo >| debian-cd/data/jessie/exclude-udebs-{i386,amd64}

Note: no matter what distribution you build an ISO from, you need to
link some $REPOSITORY aliases for it on package-server. The Makefile
takes care of that in the repoint-stable target.

The list of packages needed to be able to build is maintained in the
puppet module ut_build_slave.
